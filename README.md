# lab5

In this lab, I have to create a binary tree to hold data of Song then print them out in an inorder traversal.

The song Node of the binary tree holds, song name, song url, song streamnumber, song average number, the singer.

I made a class to hold the artist name, artist average, and list of artist song called Artist.
